# TS-Node Boilerplate
A TS-Node & EsLint boilerplate entirely configured to suit my standards.

Summary
-------
You can find here a list of the main features of this boilerplate:
- [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/) support.
- [TS-Node](https://github.com/TypeStrong/ts-node) support.
- [EsLint](https://eslint.org/) support (already configured).
- [Winston](https://github.com/winstonjs/winston) logger boilerplate.
- [Minimist](https://github.com/minimistjs/minimist) support.
- [Dedent-JS](https://github.com/MartinKolarik/dedent-js) support.
- [Date-and-time](https://www.npmjs.com/package/date-and-time) support.
- [DotEnv](https://github.com/motdotla/dotenv) support (don't forget to config load early in the app).

Here's the list of the main EsLint rules:
- **[ERROR]** UNIX linebreaks.
- **[ERROR]** Required semi-colons.
- **[WARN]** Recommended double quotes.
- **[WARN]** Two new lines after imports.
- **[WARN]** No unused variables.
